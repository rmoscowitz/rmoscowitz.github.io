Howdy.

### About

I'm a Midwestern girl, currently displaced in Texas (still working on the southern accent, but MAN I have assimilated when it comes to cuisine... can you say Tex Mex!?!). I'm a software engineer and volunteer high school CS teacher. I hope to write about both of these things, with some other stuff thrown in for fun. Thanks for visiting!
