title: Lots of Firsts

One positive thing about being bored at work is that I've become sufficiently motivated to tackle personal coing projcts (like this site!). Usually, I come home from work and do *only* things that do **not** involve a computer. However, the stars aligned this weekend and, after a slow week at work, I was totally ready to break out the laptop and write some code.

I'd been seeing ads for [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) online, and after some initial investigation and poking around, I discovered that there was a women-only coding competition happing this Saturday. I'm a very competitive person, but that competitive spirit has never really made its way into my academic or professional programming experiences. (I suspect the infamous "Imposter Symdrome", but that's a post for another time.) Anyway, I liked the fact that the competition was online, there was no pressure/nothing to lose and there were prizes for completing just one challenge (woo hoo!). There was also the happy coincedence of a Girls Coding Club meetup happening at the same time. I've never been to a GCC meetup before, but I figured maybe there would be people who could help me if I got stuck... plus if I put it on my calendar, I couldn't back out!

I'm very happy to say that I was right! Turns out, when you try new things, sometimes it turns out well (who knew). Not only did I meet some exttemely nice people, but I actually completed 3 challenges in the competion (two more than I originally thought I would)! Even though I didn't place high enough to get a real prize, I had a great experience, and would even consider doing it again. That's enough of a prize.
