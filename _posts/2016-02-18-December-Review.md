title: December Review
---

No wonder 2015 flew by so fast! We're already two months into 2016 and I'm just now posting about last December's adventures. By the time I'm ready to post about this month, it will probably be 2017!

So what made December so crazy? Besides typical holiday madness, I started a new job (woo!) and attempted a few fun projects.

### New Job
During September and October of last year, I started looking around for a new opportunity. I had been at PROS for 3.5 years and was on the cusp of being a part of a brand new project, but things had stalled. It seemed to me I was perfectly placed for great exposure and career advancement... in a year or two when the project had actually gotten off the ground. When I weighed the options of waiting to grow with PROS, or moving somewhere else and growing immediately, I decided a change was what I wanted for my career. I don't know where my career path will go, but I do know that more experiences can never hurt.

So, here I am: fortunate to be in a field where I can just decide to pick up and go, and immediately find a new and exciting opportunity. I've been at [iOffice](http://www.iofficecorp.com/) for 2 months now and I'm thrilled to be having the "small tech company" experience. And while I'm thankful to have escaped meetings and time tracking, I'm more thankful to be in a place where making technical decisions happens at all levels (not just by architects and technical leads). I'm sure I'll be writing more about this in the future.

### LightShowPi
Now that we've gotten past the serious stuff, let's talk about what happens when you combine a Raspberry Pi, 2 IKEA floor lamps, 2 strings of Christmas lights, a plastic tree and Mexicali Brass.

I have to say, this was an excellent way to spend a day of vacation. With Greg making the box to contain the raspi, relays and wires and me installing Raspbian and lightshowpi, it only took a few hours from start to seizures. 

If you'd like your own musical seizure machine, here are the instructions we followed:

* [lightshowpi](http://lightshowpi.org/getting-started/) - The program running on the raspi which is processing the music and controlling the relays.
