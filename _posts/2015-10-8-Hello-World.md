I'm starting over with a brand new GitHub Pages site. Thanks to Barry Clark for the [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) project... I've decided to fork that project and focus on actually adding content and not getting distracted by the endless styling opportunities. We'll see how long I last. ;)
