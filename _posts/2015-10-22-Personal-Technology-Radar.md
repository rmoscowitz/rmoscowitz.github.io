I originally got the idea for creating a personal technology radar after reading a blog post titled [Build Your Own Technology Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/build-your-own-technology-radar) by Neal Ford of ThoughtWorks. I was familiar with the ThoughtWorks Technology Radar but I had never considered creating a personal radar. Neal made some excellent points which convinced me to try it...

> "Once you started a career in software development, you signed a pact that promises you'll keep up with changes in that world."

and...

> "Creating a technology radar for yourself helps you formalize your thinking, and balance some technologies (more cool factor, less likely to get a new job versus huge job market, but not interesting work)."

and finally...

> "You should treat your technology portfolio like a financial portfolio: in many ways, they are the same thing. What does your financial planner tell you ? Diversify! Choose some technologies and/or skills that are widely in demand and track that demand. But you might also want to try some high risk/high reward technology gambits, like open source or mobile development."

You can see my current radar on my project page: [http://rmoscowitz.github.io/techradar/](http://rmoscowitz.github.io/techradar/)

And if you're interested in creating a personal Technology Radar, I recommend forking [bdargan/techradar](https://github.com/bdargan/techradar) and customizing the raw data.
